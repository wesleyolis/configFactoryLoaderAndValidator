# configFactoryLoaderAndValidator

This is a simple libary that allows you to define your configuration schema.
the configuration support factories, which will allow you to build
you own variants, which can then be swapped out at load time depending on the configuration found.

Also supports a loader and everything else.

Has a test suit as well.
